    <h2 id="for_anchor1">History of Our Hotel</h2>
    <div class="info_hotel"><p>Our hotel was opened in 2005 by a group of young veterinarians who are cat lovers.
                             Once they won 1 billion lottery and invested this money in building this amazing hotel and opened a huge
                              animal shelter, which is located near the hotel. If you want to adopt another fluffy friend, you can do this at our hotel.
                            All cats are vaccinated against rabies every year. These veterinarians keep working here and would be happy to answer all your questions about everything 
                            that concern you. Nowadays our hotel became a place of interest, a great number of people come 
                            here to play with cats who wait for their owners. </p></div>
    <div class="hide" id="hidden_text"><p>Although we are happy to see people who love spending time with our little friends,
                                          they don't have access to our guests. It means that strangers
                   are not allowed to interact with your pets except our staff. You should not be worried about your pets because the territory
                   is fenced and protected. We also have security cameras inside and outside the hotel. 
                   We have an amazing backyard for our beloved little predators if your pet is an outdoor cat and loves adventures.
                   Moreover, in our hotel cats do not spend their time in uncomfortable cages. They can run wherever they want. We have a lot of 
                   toys and different catâ€™s houses where they can hide and have a rest.</p></div>

                    you should not be worried about it, our veterinarians do everything that your
                     cats need. If your pet has a difficult personality, for example the cat is not 
                friendly or even agressive, you should not be worried about this either, 
                we have specialists who find a common language with combative cats. </p></div>
